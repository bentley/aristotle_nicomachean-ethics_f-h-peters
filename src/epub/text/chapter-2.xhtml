			<h2>Book II</h2>
			<h3>Moral Virtue</h3>
			<h4>1.</h4>
			<p>Excellence, then, being of these two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual excellence owes its birth and growth mainly to instruction, and so requires time and experience, while moral excellence is the result of habit or custom (Woe), and has accord- ingly in our language received a name formed by a slight change from i6’oc.* • idos, custom ; iidos, character ; tjOik^ aper-f], moral excellence : we have no similar sequence, but the Latin mos, mores, from which ” morality ” comes, covers both edos and ^dos.</p>
			<p>From this it is plain that none of the moral excel- 2 lences or virtues is implanted in us by nature; for that which is by nature cannot be altered by training. For instance, a stone naturally tends to faU down- wards, and you could not train it to rise upwards, though you tried to do so by throwing it up ten thousand times, nor could you train fire to move downwards, nor accustom anything which naturally behaves in one way to behave in any other way.</p>
			<p>The virtues,! then, come neither by nature nor 8 against nature, but nature gives the capacity for ‘ acquiring them, and this is developed by training. t It is with the moral virtues that this and the three following books are exclusively concerned, the discussion of the intellectual virtues being postponed to Book VI. aperai is often used in these books, without any epithet, for ” moral virtues,” and perhaps is so used here.</p>
			<p>Again, where we do things by nature we get the power first, and put this power forth in act afterwards : as we plainly see in the case of the senses ; for it is not by constantly seeing and hearing that we acquire those faculties, but, on the contrary, we had the power first and then used it, instead of acquiring the power by the use. But the virtues we acquire by doing the ‘ acts, as is the case with the arts too. We learn an art by doing that which we wish to do when we have learned it; we become builders by building, and harpers by harping. And so by doing just acts we become just, and by doing acts of temperance and courage we become temperate and courageous.</p>
			<p>This is attested, too, by what occurs in states ; for the legislators make their citizens good by training ; i.e. this is the wish of all legislators, and those who do not succeed in this miss their aim, and it is this that distinguishes a good from a bad constitution.</p>
			<p>Again, both the moral vu’tues and the correspond- ing vices result from and are formed by the same acts ; and this is the case with the arts also. It is by harping that good harpers and bad harpers alike are produced : and so with builders and the rest ; by building well they will become good builders, and bad builders by building badly. Indeed, if it were not so, they would not want anybody to teach them, but would all be bom either good or bad at their trades. And it is just the same with .the virtues also. It is by our conduct in our intercourse with other men that we become just or unjust, and by acting in cir- cumstances of danger, and training ourselves to feel fear or confidence, that we become courageous or cowardly. So, too, with our animal appetites and the passion of anger ; for by behaving in this way or in that on the occasions with which these passions are concerned, some become temperate and gentle, and ‘ others profligate and ill-tempered. In a word, acts of any kind produce habits or characters of the same kind.</p>
			<p>Hence we ought to make sure that our acts be of 8 a certain kind ; for the resulting character varies as they vary. It makes no small difl:erence, therefore, whether a man be trained from his youth up in this way or in that, but a great difference, or rather all the diflference.</p>
			<h4>2.</h4>
			<p>But our present inquiry has not, like the rest, i a merely speculative aim ; we are not inquiring merely in ordcr to kuow wliat excellence or virtue is, but in ordcr to bccomc good ; for otherwise it would profit us nothing. Wc uiust ask therefore about these acts, and see of what kind they are to be ; for, as we said, it is they that determine our habits or character.</p>
			<p>First of all, then, that they must be in accordance 2 with right reason is a common characteristic of them, which we shall here take for granted, reserving for future discussion * the question what this right reason is, and how it is related to the other excellences.</p>
			<p>But let it be understood, before we go on, that aU 3 reasoning on matters of practice must be in outline merely, and not scientifically exact : for, as we said at starting, the kind of reasoning to be demanded varies with the subject in hand; and in practical matters and questions of expediency there are no invariable laws, any more than in questions of health.</p>
			<p>And if our general conclusions are thus inexact, still more inexact is all reasoning about particular cases ; for these fall under no system of scientifically established rules or traditional maxims, but the agent must always consider for himself what the special occasion requires, just as in medicine or navi- gation.</p>
			<p>But though this is the case we must try to render what help we can.</p>
			<p>First of all, then, we must observe that, in matters of this sort, to fall short and to exceed are alike fatal. This is plain (to illustrate what we cannot see by what we can see) in the case of strength and health. Too much and too little exercise alike destroy strength, and to take too much meat and drink, or to take too little, is equally ruinous to health, but the fitting amount produces and increases and preserves them. Just so, then, is it with temperance also, and courage, and the other virtues. The man who shuns and » fears everything and never makes a stand, becomes a coward; while the man who fears nothing at all, but will face anything, becomes foolhardy. So, too, the man who takes his fill of any kind of pleasure, and abstains from none, is a profligate, but the man who shuns all (like him whom we call a ” boor “) is devoid of sensibility.* Thus temperance and courage are destroyed both by excess and defect, but preserved by moderation. * These two, the “boor” (aypolKos) and he who lacks sensibility (avalcrOrjTos) , are afterwards distinguished: cf. II. 7, 3 and 13,</p>
			<p>But habits or tjrpes of character are not only pro- 8 duced and preserved and destroyed by the same occa- sions and the same means, but they will also manifest themselves in the same circumstances. This is the case with palpable things like strength. Strength is produced by taking plenty of nourishment and doing plenty of hard work, and the strong man, in turn, has the greatest capacity for these. And the case is the 9 same with the virtues : by abstaining from pleasure ‘ we become temperate, and when we have become temperate we are best able to abstain. And so with courage : by habituating ourselves to despise danger, and to face it, we become courageous ; and when we have become courageous, we are best able to face danger.</p>
			<h4>3.</h4>
			<p>The plcasurc or pain that accompanies the acts l must be taken as a test of the formed habit or character.</p>
			<p>He who abstains from the pleasures of the body and rejoices in the abstinence is temperate, while he who is vexed at having to abstain is profligate ; and again, he who faces danger with pleasure, or, at any rate, without pain, is courageous, but he to whom this is painful is a coward.</p>
			<p>For moral virtue or excellence is closely con- cerned with pleasure and pain. It is pleasure that moves us to do what is base, and pain that moves us to refrain from what is noble. And therefore, as Plato says, man needs to be so trained from his youth up as to find pleasure and pain in the right objecta This is what sound education means.</p>
			<p>Another reason why virtue has to do with pleasure and pain, is that it has to do with actions and passions or affections ; but every affection and every act ia accompanied by pleasure or pain.</p>
			<p>The fact is further attested by the employment of pleasure and pain in correction ; they have a kind of curative property, and a cure is effected by administer- ing the opposite of the disease.</p>
			<p>Again, as we said before, every type of character [or habit or formed faculty] is essentially relative to, and concerned with, those things that form it for good or for ill ; but it is through pleasure and pain that bad characters are formed⁠—that is to say, through pur- suing and avoiding the wrong pleasures and pains, or pursuing and avoiding them at the wrong time, or in the wrong manner, or in any other of the various ways of going wrong that may be distinguished.</p>
			<p>And hence some people go so far as to define the virtues as a kind of impassive or neutral state of mind. But they err in stating this absolutely, instead of qualifying it by the addition of the right and wrong manner, time, etc.</p>
			<p>We may lay down, therefore, that this kind of excellence [i.e. moral excellence] makes us do what is best in matters of pleasure and pain, while vice or badness has the contrary eftect. But the following con- siderations will throw additional light on the point.* • Reading en. See Stewart.</p>
			<p>There are three kinds of things that move us to choose, and three that move us to avoid them : on the one hand, the beautiful or noble, the advantageous, the pleasant ; on the other hand, the ugly or base, the hurtful, the painful. Now, the good man is apt to go right, and the bad man to go wrong, about them aU, but especially about pleasure : for pleasure is not only common to man with animals, but also accompanies all pursuit or choice ; since the noble, and the advantageous also, are pleasant in idea.</p>
			<p>Again, the feeling of pleasure has been fostered in 8 us all from our infancy by our training, and has thus become so engrained in our life that it can scarce be washed out.* And, indeed, we all more or less make pleasure our test in judging of actions. For this 9 reason too, then, our whole inquiry must be concerned with these matters ; since to be pleased and pained in the right or the wrong way has great influence on our actions. * Actions and the accompanying feelings of pleasure and pain have so grown together, that it is impossible to separate the former and judge them apart : c/. X. 4, 11.</p>
			<p>Again, to fight with pleasure is harder than to lo fight with wrath (which Heraclitus says is hard), and virtue, like art, is always more concerned with what is harder; for the harder the task the better is success. For this reason also, then, both [moral] virtue or excellence and the science of the state must always be concerned with pleasures and pains ; for he that behaves rightly with regard to them will be good, and he that behaves badly will be bad.</p>
			<p>We will take it as established, then, that [moral] il excellence or virtue has to do with pleasures and pains ; and that the acts which produce it develop it, and also, when difi’erently done, destroy it; and that it manifests itself in the same acts which produced it,</p>
			<h4>4.</h4>
			<p>But here we may be asked what we mean by saying that men can become just and temperate only by doing what is just and temperate : surely, it may be said, if their acts are just and temperate, they themselves are already just and temperate, as they are grammarians and musicians if they do what is grammatical and musical.</p>
			<p>We may answer, I think, firstly, that this is not quite the case even with the arts. A man may do something grammatical [or write something correctly] by chance, or at the prompting of another person : he will not be grammatical till he not only does something grammatical, but also does it grammatically [or like a grammatical person], i.e. in virtue of his own know- ledge of grammar.</p>
			<p>But, secondly, the virtues are not in this point analogous to the arts. The products of art have their excellence in themselves, and so it is enough if when produced they are of a certain quality ; but in the case of the virtues, a man is not said to act justly or tem- perately [or like a just or temperate man] if what he does merely be of a certain sort⁠—he must also be in a certain state of mind when he does it ; i.e., first of all, he must know what he is doing ; secondly, he must choose it, and choose it for itself ; and, thirdly, his act must be the expression of a formed and stable character. Now, of these conditions, only one, the knowledge, is necessary for the possession of any art ; but for the possession of the vii’tues knowledge is of little or no avail, while the other conditions that result from repeatedly doing what is just and tem- perate are not a little important, but all-important.</p>
			<p>The thing that is done, therefore, is called just or 4 temperate ^yhen it is such as the just or temperate man would do ; but the man who does it is not just or temperate, unless he also does it in the spirit of the j’lst or the temperate man.</p>
			<p>It is right, then, to say that by doing what is just I a man becomes just, and temperate by doing what is temperate, while without doing thus he has no chance of ever becoming good.</p>
			<p>But most men, instead of doing thus, fly to 6 theories, and fancy that they are philosophizing and that this will make them good, like a sick man who listens attentively to what the doctor says and then disobeys all his orders. This sort of philosophizing will no more produce a healthy habit of mind than thia sort of treatment will produce a healthy habit of body.</p>
			<h4>5.</h4>
			<p>We have next to inquire what excellence or virtue is.</p>
			<p>A quality of the soul is either (1) a passion or emotion, or (2) a power or faculty, or (3) a habit or trained faculty ; and so virtue must be one of these three. By (1) a passion or emotion we mean appetite, 2 anger, fear, confidence, envy, joy, love, hate, longing, eiiiulation, pity, or generally that which is accompanied by pleasure or pain; (2) a power or faculty is that in respect of which we are said to be capable of being afiected in any of these ways, as, for instance, that in respect of which we are able to be angered or pained or to pity; and (3) a habit or trained faculty is that in respect of which we are well or ill regulated or disposed in the matter of our affections ; as, for instance, in the matter of being angered, we are ill regulated if we are too violent or too slack, but if we are moderate in our anger we are well regulated. And so with the rest. “x.</p>
			<p>Now, the virtues -afe not emotions, nor are the vices⁠—(1) because we are not called good or bad in respect of our emotions, but are called so in respect of our virtues or vices ; (2) because we are neither praised nor blamed in respect of our emotions (a man is not praised for being afraid or angry, nor blamed for being angry simply, but for being angry in a particular way), but we are praised or blamed in respect of our virtues or vices ; (3) because we may be ansrered or frio-htened without deliberate choice, but the virtues are a kind of deliberate choice, or at least are impossible without it ; and (4) because in respect • of our emotions we are said to be moved, but in respect of our virtues and vices we are not said to be moved, but to be regulated or disposed in this way or in that.</p>
			<p>For these same reasons also they are not powers ( , or faculties ; for we are not called either good or bad ‘ for being merely capable of emotion, nor are we either praised or blamed for this. And further, while nature gives us our powers or faculties, she does not make us either good or bad. (This point, however, we have already treated.)</p>
			<p>If, then, the viitues be neither emotions nor faculties, it only remains for them to be habits or trained faculties.</p>
			<h4>6.</h4>
			<p>We have thus found the genus to which virtue belongs ; but we want to know, not only that it is a trained faculty, but also what species of trained faculty it is.</p>
			<p>We may safely assert that the vh’tue or excellence 2 of a thmg causes that thing both to be itself in good condition and to perform its function well. The ex- cellence of the eye, for instance, makes both the eye and its work good ; for it is by the excellence of the eye that we see well. So the proper excellence of the horse makes a horse what he should be, and makes him good at running, and carrying his rider, and standing a charge.</p>
			<p>If, then, this holds good in all cases, the proper 3 excellence or virtue of man will be the habit or trained faculty that makes a man good and makes him per- foi m his function well</p>
			<p>How this is to be done we have already said, but 4 we may exhibit the same conclusion in another way, by inquiring what the nature of this virtue is.</p>
			<p>Now, if we have any quantity, whether continuous or discrete,* it is possible to take either a larger [or too large], or a smaller [or too small], or an equal [or fair] amount, and that either absolutely or relatively to our own needs. • A line (or a generous emotion) is a ” continuons quantity ; ” yon can part it where you please : a rouleau of sovereigns is a ” discrete quantity,” made up of definite parts^ and primarily separable into them.</p>
			<p>By an equal or fair amount I understand a mean amount, or one that lies between excess and deficiency.</p>
			<p>By the absolute mean, or mean relatively to the thing itself, I understand that which is equidistant from both extremes, and this is one and the same for all.</p>
			<p>By the mean relatively to us I understand that which is neither too much nor too little for us ; and this is not one and the same for all.</p>
			<p>For instance, if ten be larger [or too large] and two be smaller [or too small], if we take six we take the mean relatively to the thing itself [or the arithmetical mean] ; for it exceeds one extreme by the same amount by which it is exceeded by the other extreme : and this is the mean in arithmetical pro- portion.</p>
			<p>But the mean relatively to us cannot be found in this way. If ten pounds of food is too much for a given man to eat, and two pounds too little, it does not follow that the trainer will order him six pounds : for that also may perhaps be too much for the man in question, or too little ; too little for Milo, too much for the beginner. The same holds true in running and wrestlins:.</p>
			<p>And so we may say generally that a master in any art avoids what is too much and what is too little, and seeks for the mean and chooses it⁠—not the absolute but the relative mean.</p>
			<p>If, then, every art or science perfects its work in this wav, looking to the mean and bringing its work up to this standard (so that people are wont to say of a good work that nothing could be taken from it or added to it, implying that excellence is destroyed by excess or deficiency, but secured by observing the mean ; and good artists, as we say, do in fact keep their eyes fixed on this in all that they do), and if virtue, like nature, is more exact and better than any art, it follows that virtue also must aim at the mean⁠—virtue of course meaning moral virtue or excellence ; for it has to do with passions and actions, and it is these that admit of excess and deficiency and the mean. For instance, it is possible to feel feai, con- fidence, desire, anger, pity, and generall}’ ” to be affected pleasantly and painfidly, either too much or too little, in either case wrongly ; but to be thus affected at the right times, and on the right occasions, and towards the right persons, and with the right object, and in the right fashion, is the mean course and the best course, and these are characteristics of virtue. And in the same way our outward acts also admit of excess and deficiency, and the mean or due amount.</p>
			<p>Virtue, then, has to deal with feelings or passions and with outward acts, in which excess is wrong and deficiency also is blamed, but the mean amount is praised and is right⁠—both of which are characteristics of virtue.</p>
			<p>Virtue, then, is a kind of moderation (^eo-ottjc Tig)* inasmuch as it aims at the mean or moderate amount (to fieaov). • /ji.fff6Tris, the abstract name for the quality, is quite untraualatable.</p>
			<p>Again, there are many ways of going wrong (for 14 evil is infinite in nature, to use a Pythagorean figure, while good is finite), but only one way of going right ; so that the one is easy and the other hard⁠—easy to miss the mark and hard to hit. On this account also, then, excess and deficiency are characteristic O’ ” vice, hittinof the mean is characteristic of virtue : <blockquote> ” Goodness is simple, ill takes any shapa-” </blockquote></p>
			<p>Virtue, then, is a habit or trained faculty of choice, the characteristic of which lies in moderation or observance of the mean relatively to the persons concerned, as determined by reason, i.e. by the reason by which the prudent man would determine it. And it is a moderation, firstly, inasmuch as it comes in the middle or mean between two vices, one on the side of excess, the other on the side of defect ; and, secondly, inasmuch as, while these vices fall short of or exceed the due measure in feeling and in action, it finds and chooses the mean, middling, or moderate amount.</p>
			<p>Regarded in its essence, therefore, or according to the definition of its nature, virtue is a moderation or middle state, but viewed in its relation to what is best and right it is the extreme of perfection.</p>
			<p>But it is not all actions nor all passions that admit of moderation; there are some whose very names imply badness, as malevolence, shamelessness, envy, and, among acts, adultery, theft, murder. These and all other like things are blamed as being bad in them- selves, and not merely in their excess or deficiency. It is impossible therefore to go right in them ; they are always wrong: rightness and wrongness in such things (e.g. in adultery) does not depend upon whether it is the right person and occasion and manner, but the mere doing of any one of them is wrong.</p>
			<p>It would be equally absurd to look for moderation or excess or deficiency in unjust cowardly or profligate conduct ; for then there would be moderation in excess or deficiency, and excess in excess, and deficiency in deficiency.</p>
			<p>The fact is that just as there’ can be no excess or deficiency in temperance or courage because the mean or moderate amount is, in a sense, an extreme, so in these kinds of conduct also there can be no moderation or excess or deficiency, but the acts are wrong however they be done. For, to put it generally, there cannot be moderation in excess or deficiency, nor excess or deficiency in moderation.</p>
			<h4>7.</h4>
			<p>But it is not euough to make thcsc general statements [about virtue and vice] : we must go on and apply them to particulars [i.e. to the several virtues and vices]. For in reasoning about matters of conduct general statements are too vague,* and do not convey so much truth as particular propositions. It is with particulars that conduct is concerned : f our state- ments, therefore, when applied to these particulars, should be found to hold good. * Or ” cover more ground, but convey less truth than particular propositions,” if we read KOiv6T(poi with most manuscripts. + In a twofold sense : my conduct cannot be virtuous except by exhibiting the particular virtues of justice, temperance, etc. ; again, my conduct cannot be just except by being just in particular cases to particular persons.</p>
			<p>These particulars then [i.e. the several virtues and vices and the several acts and affections with which they deal], we will take from the following table. J % The Greek seems to imply that this is a generally accepted list, but Aristotle repeatedly has to coin names : cj. infra, § 11.</p>
			<p>Moderation in the feelings of fear and confidence is eourage: of those that exceed, he that exceeds in fearlessness has no name (as often happens), but he that exceeds in confidence is foolhardy, while he that exceeds in fear, but is deficient in confidence, is cowardly.</p>
			<p>Moderation in respect of certain pleasures and also (though to a less extent) certain pains is temperance, while excess is profligacy. But defect- iveness in the matter of these pleasures is hardly ever found, and so this sort of people also have as yet received no name : let us put them down as ” void of ‘ sensibility.”</p>
			<p>In the matter of giving and taking money, modera- tion is liberality, excess and deficiency are prodigality and illiberality. But both vices exceed and fall short in giving and taking in contrary ways : the prodigal exceeds in spending, but falls short in taking ; while the illiberal man exceeds in taking, but falls short in spending. (For the present we are but giving an outline or summary, and aim at nothing more ; we shall afterwards treat these points in greater detail )</p>
			<p>But, besides these, there are other dispositions in the matter of money : there is a moderation which is called magnificence (for the magnificent is not the same as the liberal man : the former deals with larsre sums, the latter with small), and an excess which is called bad taste or vulgarity, and a deficiency which is called meanness ; and these vices differ from those which are opposed to liberality : how they differ will be explained later.</p>
			<p>With respect to honour and disgrace, there is a moderation which is high-m i n dedness, an excess which ‘ may be called vanity, and a deficiency which is little- mindedness.</p>
			<p>But just as we said that liberality is related to magnificence, differing only in that it deals with small sums, so here there is a virtue related to high-mindedness, and differing only in that it is concerned with small instead of great honours. A man may have a due desire for honour, and also more or less than a due desire : he that carries this desire to excess is called ambitious, he that has not enough of it is called unambitious, but he that has the due amount has no name. There are also no abstract names for the cha- racters, except “ambition,” corresponding to ambitious. And on this account those who occupy the extremes lay claim to the middle place. And in common parlance, too, the moderate man is sometimes called ambitious and sometimes unambitious, and some- times the ambitious man is praised and sometimes the unambitious. Why this is we will explain 9 afterwards ; for the present we will follow out our plan and enumerate the other types of character.</p>
			<p>In the matter of anger also we find excess and lo deficiency and moderation. The characters themselves hardly have recognized names, but as the moderate man is here called gentle, we will call his character gentleness ; of those who go into extremes, we -may take the term wrathful for him who exceeds, with wrathfulness for the vice, and wrathless for him who is deficient, with wrathlessness for his character.</p>
			<p>Besides these, there are three kinds of moderation, ii bearing some resemblance to one another, and yet different. They all have to do with intercourse in speech and action, but they differ in that one has to do with the truthfulness of this intercourse, while the other two have to do with its pleasantness⁠—one of the two with pleasantness in matters of amusement, the other with pleasantness in all the relations of life. We must therefore speak of these qualities also in order that we may the more plainly see how, in all cases, moderation is praiseworthy, while the ex- treme courses are neither right nor praiseworthy, but blamable.</p>
			<p>In these cases also names are for the most part wanting, but we must try, here as elsewhere, to coin names ourselves, in order to make our argument clear and easy to follow.</p>
			<p>In the matter of truth, then, let us call him who observes the mean a true [or truthful] person, and observance of the mean truth [or truthfulness] : pretence, when it exaggerates, may be called boasting, and the person a boaster ; when it miderstates, let the names be irony and ironical.</p>
			<p>With regard to pleasantness in amusement, he who observes the mean may be called witty, and his character wittiness ; excess may be called buffoonery, and the man a buffoon ; while boorish may stand for the person who is deficient, and boorishness for his character.</p>
			<p>With regard to pleasantness in the other affairs of life, he who makes himself properly pleasant may be called friendly, and his moderation friendliness; he that exceeds may be called obsequious if he have no ulterior motive, but a flatterer if he has an eye to his own advantage ; he that is deficient in this respect, and always makes himself disagreeable, may be called a quarrelsome or peevish fellow.</p>
			<p>Moreover, in mere emotions * and in our conduct with regard to them, there are ways of observing the mean; for instance, shame fa/^o’^), is not a virtue, but yet the modest (otS/y^wv; man is praised. For in these matters also we speak of this man as observing the mean, of that man as going beyond it (as the shame-faced man whom the least thing makes shy), while he who is deficient in the feeling, or lacks it altogether, is called shameless ; but the term modest (aiSjj/xwv) is applied to him who observes the mean. • t.e. which do not issae in act like those hitherto mentioned.</p>
			<p>Righteous indignation, again, hits the mean between envy and malevolence. These have to do with feelings of pleasure and pain at what happens to our neighbours. A man is called righteously indignant when he feels pain at the sight of undeserved prosperity, but your envious man goes beyond him and is pained by the sight of any one in prosperity, while the malevolent man is so far from being pained that he actually exults in the misfortunes of his neighbours.</p>
			<p>But we shall have another opportunity of discussing these matters.</p>
			<p>As for justice, the term is used in more senses than one ; we will, therefore, after disposing of the above questions, distinguish these various senses, and show how each of these kinds of justice is a kind of moderation.</p>
			<p>And then we will treat of the intellectual virtues in the same way.</p>
			<h4>8.</h4>
			<p>There are, as we said, three classes of disposition, viz. two kinds of vicc, One marked by excess, the othcr by deficiency, and one kind of virtue, the ob- scrvancc of the mean. Now, each is in a way opposed to each, for the extreme dispositions are opposed both to the mean or moderate disposition and to one another, while the moderate disposition is opposed to both the extremes. Just as a quantity which is equal to a given quantity is also greater when compared with a less, and less when compared with a greater quantity, so the mean or moderate dispositions exceed as compared with the defective dispositions, and fall short as compared with the excessive dispositions, both in feeling and in action ; e.g. the courageous man seems foolhardy as compared with the coward, and cowardly as compared with the foolhardy; and similarly the temperate man appears profligate in comparison with the insensible, and insensible in comparison with the profligate man ; and the liberal man appears prodigal by the side of the illiberal man, and illiberal by the side of “ihe prodigal man.</p>
			<p>And so the extreme characters try to displace the mean or moderate character, and each represents him as falling into the opposite extreme, the coward calling the courageous man foolhardy, the foolhardy calling him coward, and so on in other cases.</p>
			<p>But while the mean and the extremes are thus opposed to one another, the extremes are strictly con- trary to each other rather than to the mean ; for they are further removed from one another than from the mean, as that which is greater than a given magni- tude is further from that which is less, and that which is less is further from that which is greater, than either the greater or the less is from that which is equal to the given magnitude.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, again, an extreme, when compared with the mean, has a sort of resemblance to it, as foolhardiness to courage, or prodigality to liberality ; but there is the greatest possible dissimilarity between the extremes.</p>
			<p>Again, ” things that are as far as possible removed from each other ” is the accepted definition of con- traries, so that the farther things are removed from each other the more contrary they are.</p>
			<p>In comparison with the mean, however, it is sometimes the deficiency that is the more opposed, and sometimes the excess; e.g. foolhardiness, which is excess, is not so much opposed to courage as cowardice, which is deficiency ; but insensibility, which is lack of feeling, is not so much opposed to temperance as profligacy, which is excess.</p>
			<p>The reasons for this are two. One is the reason derived from the nature of the matter itself: since one extreme is, in fact, nearer and more similar to the mean, we naturally do not oppose it to the mean so strongly as the other ; e.g. as foolhardiness seems more similar to courage and nearer to it, and cowardice more dissimilar, we speak of cowardice as the opposite rather than the other : for that which is further re- moved from the mean seems to be more opposed to it.</p>
			<p>This, then, is one reason, derived from the nature 8 of the thing itself Another reason lies in ourselves : and it is this⁠—those things to which we happen to be more prone by nature appear to be more op- posed to the mean : e.g. our natural inclination is rather towards indulgence in pleasure, and so we more easily fall into profligate than into regular habits: those courses, then, in. which we are more apt to run to great lengths are spoken of as more opposed to the mean ; and thus profligacy, which is an excess, is more opposed to temperance than the deficiency is.</p>
			<h4>9.</h4>
			<p>We have sufficiently explained, then, that moral virtue is moderation or observance of the mean, and in what sense, viz. (1 ) as holding a middle position between two vices, one on the side of excess, and the other on the side of deficiency, and (2) as aiming at the mean or moderate amount both in feeling and in action.</p>
			<p>And on this account it is a hard thing to be good ; for finding the middle or the mean in each case is a hard thing, just as finding the middle or centre of a circle is a thing that is not within the power of everybody, but only of him who has the requisite knowledge.</p>
			<p>Thus any one can be angry⁠—that is quite easy ; any one can give money away or spend it : but to do these things to the right person, to the right extent, at the right time, with the right object, and in the right manner, is not what everybody can do, and is by no means easy ; and that is the reason why right doing is rare and praiseworthy and noble.</p>
			<p>He that aims at the mean, then, should first of all strive to avoid that extreme which is more opposed ‘ to it, as Calypso * bids Ulysses⁠—<blockquote> ” Clear of these smoking breakers keep thy ship.” </blockquote> For of the extremes one is more dangerous^ the other less. Since then it is hard to hit the mean precisely, we must ” row when we cannot sail,” as the proverb has it, and choose the least of two evils j and that will be best effected in the way we have described * Horn., Od., xii. 101⁠–⁠110, and 219⁠–⁠220 : Calypso should be Ciroe.</p>
			<p>And secondly we must consider, each for himself, what we are most prone to⁠—for different nai,ures are inclined to different things⁠—which we may learn by ‘ the pleasure or pain we feel. And then we must bend s ourselves in the opposite direction; for by keeping well away from error we shall fall into the middle ‘ course, as we straighten a bent stick by bending it the other way.</p>
			<p>But in all cases we must be especially on our guard 6 against pleasant things, and against pleasure ; for we can scarce judge her impartially. And so, in our behaviour towards her, we should imitate the be- haviour of the old counsellors towards Helen,* and ‘ in all cases repeat their saying: if we dismiss her we shall be less likely to go wrong. • Horn.. II., iii. 154-]64.</p>
			<p>This then, in outline, is the course by which we Bhall best be able to hit the mean.</p>
			<p>But it is a hard task, we must admit, especially in a particular case. It is not easy to determine, for instance, how and with whom one ought to be angry, and upon what grounds, and for how long ; for public opinion sometimes praises those who fall short, and calls them gentle, and sometimes applies the term manly to those who show a harsh temper.</p>
			<p>In fact, a slight error, whether on the side of excess 8 or deficiency, is not blamed, but only a considerable error; for then there can be no mistake. But it is hardly possible to determine by reasoning how far or to what extent a man must err in order to incur blame ; and indeed matters that fall within the scope of perception never can be so determined. Such matters lie within the region of particulars, and can only be determined by perception.</p>
			<p>So much then is plain, that the middle character is in all cases to be praised, but that we ought to incline sometimes towards excess, sometimes towards deficiency ; for in this way we shall most easily hit the mean and attain to right doiug.</p>
